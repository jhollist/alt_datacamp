# Alt DataCamp
This repository is strictly for me to keep track of the links that provide backgound on DataCamp's very poor handling of sexual assualt by a DataCamp executive and more importantly keep links to alternatives to DataCamp handy.  

I am not attempting to have this be a one stop shop for all DataCamp alternatives, just want it to be easy for me to grab a few links to share with others when asked.
